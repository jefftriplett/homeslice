Homeslice is originally based on [pyhome][pyhome] by Andrew Crozier.

## TODO 

This is a simple python utility with similar functionality to the
functionality of the [`homesick`][homesick] ruby utility, providing a simple
interface for managing dotfiles via git repositories.

This port exists because I wanted an easier to extend version of [homesick][homesick] and [pyhome][pyhome].
